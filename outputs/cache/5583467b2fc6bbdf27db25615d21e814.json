{"description": "Sentient Salon Consensus HK Edition Where Open AGI Builders Actually Talk The Concept We gather in intimate spaces no stages, no pitches, just builders, researchers, and VCs exchanging ideas on AI agents, coordination systems, and decentralized compute. Think living room conversations with the sharpest minds in the space. Panel discussions that tackle real problems. Happy hour where collaborations form. The kind of gathering where you leave with three new Signal threads because someone just described your exact challenge from a different angle. What Happens 4:30 Doors open. Grab a drink. Meet the people building decentralized intelligence before anyone takes a stage. 5:00 Panel: AI Agent Coordination The Next Big Question The hard problems: How do agents coordinate without gatekeepers? What's blockchain's actual role? Where does human-machine coordination break down? 5:30 Panel: Building the Foundation VCs investing in AI agent infrastructure talk"}
