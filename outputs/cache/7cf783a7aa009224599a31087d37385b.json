{"description": "An invite-only evening co-hosted by Kronos Research, CoinEx, and ViaBTC, with support from Babylon, designed as a high-signal escape from conference noise. Set against the city skyline, the night brings together investors, CEX and DEX leaders, and project teams discussing token market making, OTC execution, and structured products, the operators who move real flow when markets get noisy."}
