{"description": "Dive into the rebellious side of DeFi at Liquidity Harbour Punk Mixer - an Web3 drinks rendezvous in Central Hong Kong during Consensus 2026. Raise a glass with protocol rebels, liquidity providers, yield farmers, and cypherpunk builders plotting the next permissionless revolution. No suits, no KYC, just raw on-chain vibes, wallet-to-wallet chats. Whether you are farming APYs, forking protocols, or just tapping into centralised finance, this is your harbour for forging unbreakable DeFi alliances. Limited capacity, grab your spot. Bring your edge. The event is hosted by UST Web3 Labs, BitRush, in partnership with HKGHH, one of the largest Tech/PE/VC professional communities in town.
