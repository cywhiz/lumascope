World Liberty Financial, Aster, and Opinion are hosting a private afternoon mixer for traders, founders, researchers, and ecosystem operators who prefer real conversations over conference routines. No panels. No stage. Just good drinks, good food, and a carefully curated room of people who trade, build, and move markets.
