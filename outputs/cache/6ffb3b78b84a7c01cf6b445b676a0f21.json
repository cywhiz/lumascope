{"description": "Hosted by ScalingX during Consensus HK 2026, this exclusive side event explores the powerful convergence of Artificial Intelligence and Decentralized Finance. The industry conversation has long centered on scalability. This event moves the spotlight forward into the era of autonomy. We will examine how AI is actively transforming on-chain activity through AI-driven trading, autonomous liquidity management, prediction markets, and next-generation payment systems. These are not future concepts, but emerging realities reshaping how financial systems operate without human intervention. Join founders, builders, and infrastructure leaders as we define the next chapter of intelligent finance.
